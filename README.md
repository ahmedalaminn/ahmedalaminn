Hi! I'm Ahmed, a junior majoring in Computer Science at Georgia Tech with a strong interest in software engineering and artificial intelligence.

This summer, I'm interning at EY in Tech Consulting, where I'm contributing to the development of an internal product that leverages AI and full-stack development to streamline the software development cycle. I also recently completed the course portion of the Break Through Tech AI Fellowship, earning a certificate from Cornell University in Machine Learning Foundations.

Outside of internships and academics, I am most actively involved with ColorStack, supporting its mission on campus as a member of the e-board.

Feel free to reach out about anything!
